## How to use
1. Download and open the file "CrystalTool_Installer_web"
2. Open on the file
3. Run the installer
4. After the installation is done on designated folder, go to the folder and run "CrystalTool.exe"

## Features
The software contains 4 main features.
### 1D

This can solve one dimensional population balance equations. User can save the output as well as session in an excel file.

### 3D

This can solve three dimensional population balance equations and also it can predict polyhedral growth of crystals.
Here also user can save the session and output in an excel file.

### Parameter estimation
